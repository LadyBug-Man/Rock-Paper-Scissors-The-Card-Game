# Rock-Paper-Scissors The Card Game
The goal of this project is to get me up to speed with godot. My last IDE was Unity3D several years before the pricing debacle.
I became very confident in that environment and worked on many small projects. Including the very early days of the 
Leap Motion intergration. Now I'm having to start from the ground up. 

As a self-taught/hobbyist dev I learned many bad habits
and had very poorly maintained code. Its been many years since I've done this and as a result I have forgotten a lot of what
I had learned, for better or worse. Fingers crossed I learn a lot of good habits/practices this time around.
